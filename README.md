## Explanation of the Project
This C++ project is a fun and engaging Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer! Choose the number of rounds (1-10) and get ready for a battle. The code determines winners, displays round results in a clear format, and tracks overall game statistics. The game even adds a touch of excitement by changing the screen color based on the winner: green for player victory, red for computer victory, and yellow for a draw.  Compile and run the game to test your Rock-Paper-Scissors skills!
