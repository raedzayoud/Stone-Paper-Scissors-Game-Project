## Explanation of the Project
This C++ project implements a Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer. Players can choose the number of rounds (1-10) and battle it out. The code includes functions to determine winners, display results, and track overall game statistics.  You can compile and run the game to test your Rock-Paper-Scissors skills!
